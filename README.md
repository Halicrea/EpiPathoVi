## Roadmap
- [x] From PacBio data, creating files with the genome coordinates for the methylations for a strain.
- [ ] Adding the automatic creation of a methylome visualisation with circos
- [ ] List differentials non-methylated area whithin promoter regions. 
- [ ] Calculate GC percent in each strain and for a motif to see if tend to disappear
- [x] RNA-seq analysis
- [ ] Enriching methylome results with RNA-seq data
